# Minecraft Server
I made this project for my personal use with my friends.
Sometimes we play Minecraft just for a laugh, but we don't use the paid version of the game. So it's a little annoying to create a server every time we want to play, since we change the game version many times. That's why I created this project, so that each of them can create a Minecraft server with a simple click. For now, I made a GUI to initialize the Ngrok tcp tunnel. The server startup part is still being planned.
